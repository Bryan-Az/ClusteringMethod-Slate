# A slate of various Clustering Methods
An assignment for CMPE 255 - Data Mining where various clustering methods will be used on a set of data. This includes:

a) K-Means clustering from scratch

b) Hierarchical clustering (not from scratch)

c) Gaussian mixture models clustering (not from scratch)

d) DB Scan clustering (not from scratch) using pycaret library 

e) Anomaly detection using pyOD using any usecase (eg: univariate or multivariate) 

f) Clustering of timeseries data using pretrained models 

Furthermore, clustering (with any method) will be used to analyze different types of data, such as text documents, audio data and images. These will be split into...

g) A colab to illustrate clustering  of documents. use state of art embeddings (LLM Embeddings).

h) A colab for clustering with images using imagebind llm embeddings 

i) A colab for audio embeddings using imagebind llms
